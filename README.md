## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS Classes
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

Dynamic layouts are not as easy as I thought.
At first, I figured the `<picture>` tag would be adequate to switch between
images at different screes sizes. But it turns out the images switches positions
from the start of

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("🎉");
};
```
